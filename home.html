    <h2>ABOUT KITCHEN</h2>
    <P>Founded in 2000, Chic-Chic-Chicken® has more than 20 years of history and culinary tradition. 
    Chic-Chic-Chicken® owes its beginnings to entrepreneur and culinary innovator, Al Copeland. With 
    one small restaurant and a big idea, Copeland introduced the New Orleans–style fried chicken that has now made 
    the brand famous throughout the world. Chic-Chic-Chicken® culinary heritage is
     built upon the rich Cajun and creole flavor profiles that are unmistakably Louisiana. 
     We continuously draw upon and celebrate this heritage to inspire new, authentic menu creations the world 
     craves. Chic-Chic-Chicken distinguishes itself with a unique New Orleans style menu featuring spicy chicken, chicken
    tenders, fried shrimp and other regional items. This unique and flavourful food has allowed Chic-Chic-Chicken to become 
    one of the world’s largest chicken quick service restaurants, in North America. And around the world.
